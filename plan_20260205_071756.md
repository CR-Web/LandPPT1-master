The issue is caused by CSS rules injected into the preview iframe that force the first slide to always be visible (`display: block !important`), which overrides the logic attempting to show other slides. Since the slides are positioned relatively, the first slide pushes subsequent slides down or covers them, making it appear as if the page hasn't switched.

To fix this, I will modify `normalizeSlotConfigFrameHtml` and `injectMultiSlidePreviewSupport` in `src/landppt/web/static/js/global_master_templates.js` to remove the `.slide:first-of-type { display: block !important }` rule. The active slide will instead be controlled solely by the `.active` class, which is already correctly managed by the JavaScript logic.

**Steps:**
1.  **Edit `src/landppt/web/static/js/global_master_templates.js`**:
    *   Locate `normalizeSlotConfigFrameHtml` (around line 354) and `injectMultiSlidePreviewSupport` (around line 374).
    *   Update the `visibilityStyle` strings in both functions to remove the rule that forces the first slide to be block-displayed (`.slide:first-of-type...`).
    *   Ensure the `.active` class rule remains to handle visibility.

2.  **Verify**:
    *   The JavaScript logic in `showSlotConfigPreviewPage` (which runs on load and on tab switch) already adds the `.active` class to the correct slide. This ensures the correct slide is shown.
    *   I will run the compilation check to ensure no syntax errors are introduced.
    *   (Self-Correction/Edge Case): If JS is disabled or fails, the preview might be blank. However, this is an interactive app requiring JS, and `onload` handlers ensure the first page is activated, so this trade-off is acceptable for correct functionality.

This change will allow the "Content", "Table of Contents", and "Conclusion" tabs to correctly display their respective slides by hiding the "Cover" slide when it is not active.
